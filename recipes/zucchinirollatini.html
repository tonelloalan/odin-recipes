    <h2>Juicy and delicious</h2>
    <p>
      These zucchini rollatini are ribbons of zucchini, filled with ricotta,
      mozzarella, and herbs, and baked in marinara sauce, a bit like lasagna
      roll-ups, but without the pasta.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 (12 ounce) zucchinis, sliced lengthwise into 18 (1/8-inch-thick)
        planks
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese, patted dry</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 clove garlic, grated</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups shredded whole milk mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>2 cups jarred marinara sauce (such as Rao’s®), divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C) with racks in top third and lower third positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss zucchini slices with oil and 2 teaspoons salt on 2 large rimmed
        baking sheets; arrange in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven
        until tender, about 10 minutes, rotating baking sheets from top to
        bottom halfway through cook time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, and let zucchini slices cool slightly, about 5
        minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, stir together ricotta, egg, basil, oregano, lemon zest,
        pepper, garlic, 1 cup of the mozzarella, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, and
        remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly coat a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread 1 cup
        marinara sauce evenly in the bottom of the baking dish. Gently pat
        zucchini slices dry with paper towels. Spoon about 1 tablespoon plus 1
        teaspoon ricotta mixture on 1 end of 1 zucchini slice; roll up, and
        place roll, seam-side down, into the marinara in the dish. Repeat
        process with remaining zucchini slices and ricotta mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour remaining 1 cup marinara evenly over center of zucchini rolls,
        leaving roll ends exposed. Sprinkle rolls evenly with remaining 1/2 cup
        mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, slightly browned, and
        zucchini is very tender, about 25 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes. Garnish
        with basil.
      </li>
    </ol>
